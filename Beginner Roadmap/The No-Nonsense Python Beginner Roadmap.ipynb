    "# The No-Nonsense Python Beginner Roadmap: A Handy Buddy to Prepare Your Jump From Beginner to Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet definitely contains numerous resources about Python. And there is definitely no shortage of guides or tutorials for beginners. Such bountiful resources come with a cost, though: as a beginner, it is hard to sift through tutorials once you get past through the basics, but still feel something being missing before \"expanding vocabulary\" (e.g. utilizing the standard library, exploring a framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "What I mean by this is that often, and rightfully so, beginner guides cover basic concepts like variables, loops, and command line and file I/O. After that, beginners will often be given a third-party library for practical applications like dealing with PDFs and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, these are enough skillset for someone to use tools like `pandas` or ` Django`. But soon enough, the beginners will start to ask, \"Is that really it? Is *the* bunch of programming work just about knowing libraries/tools/frameworks and reading documentation/internet threads?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is YES, so experienced developers will often reply an affirmation. However, I think there are layers to this question that I think would have been helpful to address in such discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap is made for you if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have covered several beginner guides and don't know where to go next.\n",
    "- You feel like you're way past the basics but still don't feel belonging to intermediate.\n",
    "- You have searched for intermediate guides and thought \"Woah, these are too advanced. Those words scare me.\"\n",
    "- You have searched for intermediate guides and thought \"Aren't these just a bunch of new libraries/functions? I can learn them later when the need arise!\"\n",
    "- You feel like you are missing *the* big picture. "

    "\n",
    "> Welcome to *Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python*. More than a mere collection of `advanced syntax` and masterful tips for `writing clean code`, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like `code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control`. Sweigart takes you through best practices for `setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability`, then tackles `documentation, organization and performance measurement`, as well as `object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm` analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language.\n",

    "Judging from these resources, the scope of what constitutes an \"intermediate\" skill is quite convoluted. Does knowing *Functional Programming* make one an intermediate? Does knowing *Object-Oriented Programming* make you one? What are environments? What are data structures and algorithms? What is version control? These are a lot of questions with no linear connections whatsoever.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this roadmap, we can define an intermediate developer to be someone who can share code to other people and be confident (1) justifying why they wrote the code in such a way; and (2) knowing that the code they wrote will bother other people with the least amount of time, effort and money possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to justify your code means you were aware of choices, and a choice has been made. This enables developers to pro-actively learn for themselves, not just from documentations and tutorials but also from experience and discussions with other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bothering other people with the least amount of resource isn't just confined to writing \"clean code\" filled with comments or whatnot. Code with its own testing and good error handling also contribute to that."

    "# First of all, Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is less obvious to people who have no prior programming experience. Some people chose Python not exactly because of its features but because of reasons as popularity, or that they saw online that it's good for beginners, or because it is a school requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's say you want to solve a problem, and that problem is to print integers 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the code in C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n",
    "        std::cout << i;\n",
    "    }\n",
    " \n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "  console.log(i)\n",
    "}\n",

    "```\n",

    "I presented the same code between three languages not to illustrate differences (e.g. \"Python had the easiest, simplest one!\") but to show a similarity &mdash; the fact that what you can do with Python, you can also do with other languages. let's ask ourselves again the question, why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, compiling the C++ code would provide you a *.exe* file; Javascript runs in all browsers. For other users to run your Python code, they also need to have Python installed. Despite that, what makes Python popular? And why do we have to ask on a discussion about a developer's skill level?\n",
